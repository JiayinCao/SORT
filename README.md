## Introduction
SORT, short for Simple Open-source Ray Tracing, is my personal cross platform ray tracing renderer. It is a standalone ray tracing program, while works well in Blender as a renderer plugin. Simliar to other open source ray tracer, like PBRT, luxrenderer, SORT is also a physically based renderer. However, since it is a solo project that I worked on in my spare time, it is way simpler comparing with its peers.

This is just a brief introduction of SORT. For further detail, please check out [SORT main page](https://sort-renderer.com).

## Features

Here are the features implemented so far:
  - Integrator. (Whitted ray tracing, direct lighting, path tracing, light tracing, bidirectional path tracing, instant radiosity, ambient occlusion)
  - Spatial acceleration structure. (OBVH, QBVH, BVH, KD-Tree, Uniform grid, OcTree)
  - BXDF. (Disney BRDF, Lambert, LambertTransmission, Oran Nayar, MicroFacet Reflection, Microfacet Transmission, MERL, Fourier, AshikhmanShirley, Modified Phong, Coat, Blend, Double-Sided, DistributionBRDF, DreamWorks Fabric BRDF, Transparent)
  - Subsurface Scattering
  - Fur, Hair
  - Volumetric Rendering
  - [Tiny Shading Language](https://jiayincao.github.io/Tiny-Shading-Language/)
  - Depth of Field
  - Multi-thread rendering, SIMD(SSE,AVX) optimized
  - Blender 2.8 plugin
  - Cross-platform (Windows, Ubuntu, MacOS)
