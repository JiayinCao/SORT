//! @brief   MemoryAllocator is responsible for allocating small trunk of memory in a fast way.
/**
 * The main purpose of MemoryAllocator is to allocate small trunk of memory in a faster way than
 * naive 'new' method. MemoryAllocator achieves this by allocating a memory pool beforehand.
 * With a memory pool, memory allocation through MemoryAllocator benefits from avoiding page
 * allocation under the hood. And the other benefit it gets is memory deallocation is not needed
 * any more. There is no way to release allocated memory block for simplicity. Although SORT is
 * memory protected by std::unique_ptrs, there is still a possibility for it to leak memory if
 * a std::unique_ptr is allocated through this memory allocator. It is up to the higher level
 * code to make sure it doesn't happen.
