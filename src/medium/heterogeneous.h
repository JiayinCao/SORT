    //! traveling through the medium. It is a spectrum dependent attenuation.

    //! @param  ray         The ray, which it uses to evaluate beam transmittance.
    //! @param  max_t       The maximum distance to be considered, usually this is the distance the ray travels before it hits a surface.
    //! @return             The attenuation of each spectrum channel.

    //! @brief  Importance sampling a point along the ray in the medium.
    //!
    //! This is no way to use Delta-Tracking algorithm due to the lack of context of maximum density because
    //! density is a shader driven property, there is no way to explictly evaluate the maximum value.
    //!
    //! @param ray          The ray we use to take sample.
    //! @param max_t        The maximum distance to be considered, usually this is the distance the ray travels before it hits a surface.
    //! @param mi           The interaction sampled.
    //! @param emission     The emission contribution in RTE.
    //! @return             The beam transmittance between the ray origin and the interaction.
