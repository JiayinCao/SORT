    //! @brief  Sample a direction given the intersection.
    //!
    //! Given an intersection, do importance sampling to pick a direction from intersection to light source.
    //! For some light sources, light point light, spot light and distant light, it is trival. However, it
    //! needs some decent algorithm to make it efficient for some other light sources like area light.
    //!
    //! @param  ip              The point where we are interested in shading at.
    //! @param  ls              The light sample information.
    //! @param  dirToLight      The resulting direction goes from the intersection to light source.
    //! @param  distance        The distance from the intersected point to the sampled point, which is the intersection
    //!                         between the out-going direction and the light source.
    //! @param  pdfw            The resulting pdf w.r.t solid angle to pick such a direction.
    //! @param  emissionPdf     The pdf w.r.t solid angle if such a direction and position ( which is the intersection
    //!                         between the resulting direction to the light source ) is picked by the light source.
    //! @param  cosAtLight      The cos of the angle between the light out-going direction, the opposite of 'dirToLight'.
    //! @param  visibility      The visibility data structured filled by the light source.
    //! @return                 The radiance goes from the light source to the intersected point.

    //! @param  ls              The light sample.
    //! @param  r               The resulting sampled ray.
    //! @param  pdfA            The pdf w.r.t area of picking such a light out-going ray. It is simply one for delta light.
    //! @param  cosAtLight      The cos of the angle between the light out-going direction, the opposite of 'dirToLight'.
    //! @return                 The radiance goes from the light source to the intersected point.

    //!
    //! The reason it is just an approximation is because there are certain kinds of light
    //! whose power is hard to evaluate, like distant light, sky light. Since this value is
    //! only used to pick a light for importance sampling, it is fine to be biased.

    //! @brief  The pdf w.r.t solid angle if the ray starting from 'p', tracing through 'wi' hits the light source.'
    //!
    //! Instead of checking whether p and wi is valid, it always returns 1.0. It is higher level code's responsibility to
    //! make sure nothing wrong happens.
    //!
    //! @param  p       The point in world space to be shaded.
