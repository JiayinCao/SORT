//! @brief  Line is a common type for hair or fur rendering.
/**
 * Although being called line, this shape is essentially open cylinder. Other choose is to represent line
 * with billboard like faces that always face the ray, which is not physically accurate and can easily lead
 * problems like self shadowing.
 * With cylinder as the line shape, it represents a surface in 3D space that doesn't depend on anything else.
 * This is more robust in term of ray-shape intersection and leads way less problem than billboard solution,
 * which may work well if the radius is small enough, but it is still buggy.
