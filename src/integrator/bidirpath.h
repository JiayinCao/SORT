//! @brief  Bidirectional path tracing integrator.
/**
 * Different from path tracing algorithm, which could end up in having trouble finding paths with reasonable 
 * contribution, bi-directional path tracing shoots rays from both sides, camera and lights, and then it connects
 * all paths generated from both sides.
 * The fact that bi-directional path tracing generates rays from light, allows it to evaluate Monte Carlo estimation
 * way more efficient than a standard path tracing algorithm.
 *
 * However, due to my limited spare time, there is no SSS and volume support in it for now. This is also not very high
 * priority in my to-do list for now.
