//! @brief  Instant radiosity integrator.
/**
 * Instant Radiosity is a subset of directional path tracing. It has two seperate passes.
 * First pass generates virtual light sources along the path tracing from light sources.
 * Second pass will use those virtual light source to evaluate indirect illuimination.
 * Direct illumination is handled the same way in directlight integrator.
