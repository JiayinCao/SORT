//! @brief  ScatteringEvent is a bsdf/bssrdf holder that could hold multiple of each.
/**
 * ScatteringEvent is the new 'BSDF' class, which not only holds BRDF/BTDF, but also holds BSSRDF for sub-surface 
 * scattering. This is more advanced than previous 'BSDF' implementation in a way that it supports multiple layer 
 * of BSSRDFs and it handles BSSRDF the same way with BXDF.
 * The rest of the system will have the knowledge about which sample it takes, but the detail how it is picked and 
 * its pdf of picking it could be simply ignored.
 * This should be a fairly light layer with minimal performance overhead that hides some detail of picking 
 * bxdf/bssrdfs. Most data should be transparent to the rest of the system.
