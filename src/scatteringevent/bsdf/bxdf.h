/**
 * Bxdf is either BRDF(bidirectional reflection density function) or BTDF( bidirectional translation density function).\n
 * This class serves as a basic interface for varies bxdf types, it will not have any instance of itself. \n
 * One of the important concept used here is local coordinate and shading coordinate. Local coordinate means a local
 * coordinate where the up axis ( Y axis ) is exactly the geometry normal. Shading coordinate is slightly different from
 * local coordinate in the fact that its up axis could differ from geometry normal, named as a shading normal, usually
 * taken from normal map.
