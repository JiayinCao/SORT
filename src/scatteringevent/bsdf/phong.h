//! @brief Phong BRDF.
/**
 * A modified version of Phong BRDF, following is the exact algorithm that is used in this BRDF with slightly modification in term of exposed parameters.
 * 'Using the modified Phong reflection model for physically based rendering'
 * http://mathinfo.univ-reims.fr/IMG/pdf/Using_the_modified_Phong_reflectance_model_for_Physically_based_rendering_-_Lafortune.pdf
 * Following is the original paper proposed Phong shading model, which is not exactly PBS due to its lack of energy conservation
 * 'Illumination for Computer Generated Pictures'
 * http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ago820/cs395/Papers/Phong_1975.pdf
 *
 * Although this modified Phong model is a PBR based BRDF, its non-PBR parameter interface really limits its application.
 * As a matter of fact, this is no guarantee that the original modified BRDF is energy conservative if DiffuseColor combined with SpecularColor is larger 1.
 * It was explicitly mentioned in the paper that the sum of diffuse and specular has to be smaller to be physically based. However, such an implicit constraint
 * is not very user-friendly to artist because sometimes, especially when it is driven by textures, it is not quite easy to obey the rule.
 * For this very reason, SORT provides a lerp factor forcing this BRDF to be smaller than 1 to keep it PBR based.
 * It is strongly not suggested to use this BRDF in practice. Switching to more advanced BRDF, like Microfacet or AshikhmanShirley, would be a much better idea.
 * Modern game engines have already deprecated this model for several years ever since they switched to physically based shading model.
