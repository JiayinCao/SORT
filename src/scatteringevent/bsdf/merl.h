/**
 * MERL is short for Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. They provide some measured
 * brdf on the website http://www.merl.com/brdf/. Merl class is responsible for loading
 * and displaying the brdf they provided in the renderer.\n
 * There is no importance sampling for this brdf. With the default sampling method, the
 * convergence rage is extremely low.
 * The paper <a href="http://csbio.unc.edu/mcmillan/pubs/sig03_matusik.pdf">
 * "A Data-Driven Reflectance Model"</a> didn't propose an importance sampling method
 * for it. Further research is needed before it can be practical to be used.
