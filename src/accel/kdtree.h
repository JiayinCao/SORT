/**
 * A KD-Tree is a spatial partitioning data structure for organizing primitives in a
 * k-dimensional space. In the context of a ray tracer, k usually equals to 3. KD-Tree
 * is a very popular spatial data structure for accelerating ray tracing algorithms
 * and it is also one of the most efficient ones.
