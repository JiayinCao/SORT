//! @brief Spatial acceleration structure interface.
/**
 * Accelerator is an interface rather than a base class. There is no instance of it.
 * It is responsible for acceleration of intersection tests between ray and primitives.
 * Tracing a ray against the scene without a spatial acceleration structure is O(N) where
 * N is the number of primitives. Spatial acceleration structure can optimize the
 * algorithm so that it is O(lg(N)), a significant improvement over the naive brute
 * force ray tracing. Common spatial structures include KD-Tree, BVH and Uniform Grid.
