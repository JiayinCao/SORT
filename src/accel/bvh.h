//! @brief Bounding volume hierarchy.
/**
 * A bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is a tree structure on a set of geometric objects.
 * All geometric objects are wrapped in bounding volumes that form the leaf nodes of the
 * tree. These nodes are then grouped as small sets and enclosed within larger bounding
 * volumes. These, in turn, are also grouped and enclosed within other larger bounding
 * volumes in a recursive fashion, eventually resulting in a tree structure with a single
 * bounding volume at the top of the tree. Bounding volume hierarchies are used to support
 * several operations on sets of geometric objects efficiently, such as in collision
 * detection or ray tracing.
 * BVH(Bounding volume hierarchy) is a classic spatial acceleration structure commonly
 * used in ray tracing applications. This is a sah BVH implementation whose construction
 * is in O(N*lg(N)).
 * Please refer to this paper
 * <a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~wald/Publications/2007/ParallelBVHBuild/fastbuild.pdf">
 * On fast Construction of SAH-based Bounding Volume Hierarchies</a> for further details.

    //! coming from that point. This is not strictly correct, but I would choose to live with it because it is not worth the extra
