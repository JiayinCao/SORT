    //! It will return true if there is intersection between the ray and the primitive set.
    //! In case of an intersection, it will fill the structure and return the nearest intersection.
    //! This intersection could possibly be a fully transparent intersection, it is up to the higher
    //! level logic to handle (semi)transparency later.
    //!
    //! @param r            The input ray to be tested.
    //! @param intersect    The intersection result. If a nullptr pointer is provided,
    //!                     it stops as long as it finds an intersection. It is faster
    //!                     than the one with intersection information data and suitable
    //!                     for shadow ray calculation.

    //! @brief This is a dedicated interface for detecting shadow rays.
    //!
    //! Instead of merging the interface with 'GetIntersect', this is a separate interface purely for occlusion detection.
    //! There is a need for it so that we can achieve better performance. There will be less branch in this interfaces and
    //! most importantly the traversed node doesn't need to be sorted.
    //!
    //! @param r            The ray to be tested.

    //! @brief Get multiple intersections between the ray and the primitive set using spatial data structure.
    //!
    //! This is a specific interface designed for SSS during disk ray casting. Without this interface, the algorithm has to use the
    //! above one to acquire all intersections in a brute force way, which obviously introduces quite some duplicated work.
    //! The intersection returned doesn't guarantee the order of the intersection of the results, but it does guarantee to get the
    //! nearest N intersections.
    //! WARNING, it is quite possible to find an intersection that is fully transparent and still taking consideration of the light
    //! coming from that point. This is not strictly correct, but I would choose to live with it because it is not worth the extra
    //! performance overhead to fix the problem since it is very minor.
    //!
    //! @param  r           The input ray to be tested.
    //! @param  intersect   The intersection result that holds all intersection.
